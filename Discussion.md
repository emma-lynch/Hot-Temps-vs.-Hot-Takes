Potential Bias:
  Sampling Bias:The dataset only includes Twitter users' opinions and ideas on  climate change, which not representative of the general population. Social media users skew younger and more politically engaged. High-volume posters can disproportionately affect results. 

  Oudated data: The data used in this analysis is only representative of Twitter from 2006-2011, making the newest data 14 years old. 

  Sentiment Bias: Sentiment models trained on general text may misinterpret sarcasm, internet sland, rhetorical questions, and scientific language. Climate discourse is often nuanced, meaning simple positive/negative labels may oversimplify real opinions

  Correlation ≠ Causation: Strong associations do not confirm cause and effect. 

Recommendations for Future Updates: 
  Broadening data sources: Using multiple social platforms for a more representative sample. Comparing platform sentiment by platform to check if Twitter is more negative of extreme. 

  Current data collection: Use Selenium to scrape Twitter and other platforms to get constantly up to date data.
